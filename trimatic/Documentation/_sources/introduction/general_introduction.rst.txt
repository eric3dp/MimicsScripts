Overview
==============
Materialise 3-matic is a software that combines CAD tools with pre-processing (meshing) capabilities. 
To do this, it works on triangulated (STL) files which makes it suitable for freeform 3D data, 
like the anatomical data coming from the segmentation of medical images (from Mimics). 

3-matic may be used to import anatomical data and other 3D objects in STL format or in various other CAD formats including: CATIA, IGES, STEP, etc. 
Once objects are loaded, they can be used for many applications of Engineering on Anatomy such as: measuring, designing, modeling and 3D printing.

The modules that can be obtained for 3-matic enable you to do thorough 3D measurements and analyses, design an implant or surgical guide, or prepare the mesh for finite element modeling. 
Materialise also develops separate software for additive manufacturing that is ideal for preparing your medical models or devices for any 3D printing system. Contact us for more information.

3-matic supports Python scripting. The 3-matic Python API makes it possible to script many 3-matic features. 
You can write your own Python scripts and call the features from 3-matic. This allows you to automate your workflows. 
3-matic comes with instructions for installing Python and includes a basic script editor and a basic scripting console.

In this scripting guide 3-matic stands for Materialise 3-matic Medical when used with the Medical edition of the software and Materialise 3-matic in the other case.
