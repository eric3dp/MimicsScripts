Benchtop model
--------------

In this scripting tutorial, we will be creating a benchtop model similar to Exercise 6 from Chapter 4: Design in the 3-matic tutorial. 
The script can be found in the 3-matic installation folder in :file:`DemoFiles\\scripts\\benchtop.py`.
The script starts from a user prepared file that can be found in :file:`DemoFiles\\AAA_trimmed.mxp`. 
The script showcases many API functions and implements a complex workflow. For further details, we refer to the comments in the Python script.
