Using an External IDE
-----------------------


Once Python and an external IDE are properly installed, it is possible to run and debug 3-matic scripts via this external IDE.
This functionality is accessible via the **Script -> Listener** from the menu bar in 3-matic.

Once activated, “3-matic script listener is active on port 15000” will appear in the logger, as shown below.
This indicates that the previously configured connection to the external IDE is active and 3-matic scripts can be run and debugged.

Once the work with the external IDE is complete, you can then toggle the listener off. This will close the connection and produce a logger message “3-matic script listener is deactivated”.
