Introduction
==========================

3-matic scripting now supports direct integration with external IDEs. This new functionality allows you to write, run and debug 3-matic scripts through external IDEs like PyCharm and Eclipse.

External IDEs facilitates you to:

•	Manage complex scripts with multiple files
•	Code editing and refactoring tools
•	Package and environment management

3-matic’s direct integration with external IDEs is primarily focused on enabling you to write and debug scripts in a polished Python environment. However, there is a delay in running scripts through an external IDE. Therefore, it is recommended that you run scripts through 3-matic for normal operations.

Moreover, you will avoid small differences in Python types in some advanced use cases. In the following use cases, you can find different behavior of a script in 3-matic vs external IDE.
