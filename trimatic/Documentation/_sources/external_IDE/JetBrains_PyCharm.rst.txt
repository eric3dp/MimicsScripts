1. Install the RPyC package. For more information on how to do so, please refer to the following section: :ref:`installing_packages`

2. Install the lastest version of PyCharm Community: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows
		
3. Launch PyCharm and click on **New Project**. Set up the "Previously configured interpreter" by clicking on "Add local interpreter...".

4. Select System Interpreter, then select the path to python.exe in your local Python directory "C:\\Program Files\\Python310\\python.exe".
This location should reflect the Python directory where the RPyC package has been installed.
Then, click **OK** and **Create**.
