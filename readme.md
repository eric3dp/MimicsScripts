The `MimicsScripts` repository contains Python scripts tailored for automating tasks within Materialise Mimics and 3-matic software suites. Below is a concise overview of each script:

- **`add_prefix.py`**: Appends a prefix, derived from the project folder name, to selected parts' names to standardize naming conventions. 

- **`boolean_union.py`**: Merges selected parts into a single entity using the boolean union operation. 

- **`cut_windows.py`**: Cuts windows into selected parts based on a specified sketch, extruding the sketch to create cutting planes and performing the cut operation. 

- **`duplicate.py`**: Duplicates selected parts within the project.

- **`export_part_stl.py`**: Exports selected parts as STL files for 3D printing or further processing.

- **`flip_normals.py`**: Reverses the normals of selected parts, which can be crucial for correct 3D printing and visualization.

- **`hide_parts.py`**: Hides selected parts from the current view, aiding in decluttering the workspace.

- **`hollow.py`**: Creates a hollow shell within selected parts, specifying wall thickness and other parameters. 

- **`move_parts.py`**: Translates selected parts to a new location based on user-defined coordinates.

- **`rename_parts.py`**: Renames selected parts according to a user-defined naming scheme.

- **`scale_parts.py`**: Scales selected parts by a specified factor, useful for resizing models.

- **`select_parts.py`**: Selects parts based on specific criteria, facilitating batch operations.

- **`shell_parts.py`**: Generates a shell around selected parts, which can be useful for creating outer layers or molds.

- **`split_parts.py`**: Splits selected parts into multiple segments based on defined parameters.

- **`trimatic.py`**: Serves as a utility module providing common functions and classes used by other scripts.

**Usage Instructions**:

1. **Setup**: Ensure Python is installed and configured to work with Materialise Mimics and 3-matic. Detailed setup instructions can be found in the [Materialise tutorial](https://www.materialise.com/en/academy/healthcare/mimics-innovation-suite/video-tutorials/install-python). citeturn0search1

2. **Execution**: Run the desired script within the Mimics or 3-matic scripting environment. Some scripts may prompt for user input or require specific selections within the software.

3. **Dependencies**: The scripts utilize the `trimatic` module, which interfaces with Mimics and 3-matic functionalities. Ensure this module is accessible within your scripting environment.
